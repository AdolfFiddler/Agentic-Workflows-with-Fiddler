       "'QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\\n# Time to place our bets: Europe’s AI opportunity\\n\\n##### Boosting Europe’s competitiveness across the AI value chain.\\n\\n_[by Alexander Sukharevsky, Eric Hazan, Sven Smit, Marc-Antoine de la Chevasnerie, Marc de Jong,](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/alexander-sukharevsky)_\\n_[Solveigh Hieronimus, Jan Mischke, and Guillaume Dagorret](https://www.mckinsey.com/our-people/solveigh-hieronimus)_\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### At a glance\\n\\n— A three-lens approach–on adoption,\\n\\ncreation, and energy–is required to assess\\nEurope’s competitiveness in the emerging\\ngenerative AI (gen AI) economy. While much\\nof the current discourse centers around large\\nlanguage models (LLMs), European policy\\nmakers and business leaders must look\\nbeyond LLMs. Adopting a holistic approach to\\ncapitalize fully on gen AI’s potential could boost\\nEuropean labor productivity by up to 3 percent\\nannually through 2030.\\n\\n— On adoption, European organizations lag\\n\\nbehind their US counterparts by 45 to\\n70 percent. Yet this is where most of gen AI’s\\neconomic potential lies. With the technology still\\nin its early stages and much of its productivity\\ngains yet to be unlocked, the window of\\nopportunity for Europe remains wide open.\\n\\n— On creation, Europe leads in only one of the\\n\\neight segments of a simplified gen AI value\\nchain: AI semiconductor equipment. Europe is\\na challenger in three other segments: foundation\\nmodels, AI applications, and AI services. But\\nit has below 5 percent market share in the\\nremaining four: raw materials, AI semiconductor\\ndesign, AI semiconductor manufacturing, and\\ncloud infrastructure and supercomputers.\\n\\n— On energy, gen AI is expected to accelerate\\n\\ndata center power demand, potentially\\naccounting for more than 5 percent of\\nEurope’s total electricity consumption by\\n2030. Without competitive electricity prices, it\\nbecomes less likely that European data centers\\nwill host gen AI applications and services.\\n\\n\\n— Europe has made major progress in raising\\n\\nAI awareness and setting commitments,\\nbut major bottlenecks persist. Policy makers\\nand business leaders could explore several\\nlevers, including increasing investments\\n(such as a public innovation procurement\\nin AI applications for healthcare and\\ndefense sectors), leapfrogging in emerging\\nsemiconductor technologies (such as quantum\\nand neuromorphic computing), and addressing\\ntalent retention. Additionally, preparing the\\nworkforce through reskilling and mobility\\nprograms will be crucial in fully leveraging\\nthe benefits of gen AI adoption.\\n\\n###### A holistic approach to help Europe realize generative AI’s full potential\\n\\nFor generative AI (gen AI),[1] the blockbuster release\\nof OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022 marked\\nthe beginning of a boom.[2] Since then, much of the\\nconversation around the technology has focused\\non foundation models, particularly large language\\nmodels (LLMs). In this field, Europe[3] appears to be\\nlagging behind its counterparts. However, LLMs are\\njust one part of the gen AI landscape. Engaging on\\ngen AI adoption, creation, and energy requirements\\ncan help capture a more complete picture of where\\nthe region stands in the emerging gen AI economy.\\n\\nMost of the value generated by gen AI will stem\\nfrom organizations’ adoption and scaling of gen AI\\nsolutions[4]—an important consideration in Europe,\\nwhere labor productivity has been slowing.[5]\\nMcKinsey Global Institute (MGI) research estimates\\nthat gen AI could help Europe achieve an annual\\nproductivity growth rate of up to 3 percent through\\n2030 (Exhibit 1).[6] This potential additional growth\\n\\n\\n1 In this article, unless specified otherwise, “generative AI” (gen AI) encompasses all AI technologies, including the latest advancements in gen AI.\\n2 By January 2023, the company had already gained 100 million users and was valued at $29 billion ($80 billion today). This triggered massive\\n\\ninvestments to fund gen AI companies ($25 billion in worldwide private investments in 2023) and spurred the release of multiple breakthrough\\ninnovations and competing models (for example, Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama).

Since not all AI spending is external—\\nsome, such as hiring AI engineers, is internal—we\\nalso examined general IT spending, of which AI is\\na component, as an indicator of IT readiness and\\na crucial foundation for AI adoption. Finally, we\\nfactored in the responses of European executives to\\nthe McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI.[12]\\n\\nWe analyzed the first two metrics both in absolute\\nterms and relative to company sales, comparing\\nthem with US figures when possible. This relative\\ncomparison helps account for differences in sector\\nsize, which would otherwise skew the data because\\nof economies of scale. For instance, the high-tech\\nand software sector is 4.9 times larger in the United\\nStates than in Western Europe,[13] so we find an AI\\nexternal spend-to-sales ratio of 0.4 percent for\\nthe United States versus 0.7 percent for Western\\nEurope. But in AI external spend absolute value,\\nwe find $8.7 billion versus $2.6 billion, respectively,\\nleading to a 70 percent gap.\\n\\nAdditionally, with the two first metrics, figures show\\nthat companies in Western Europe lag behind their\\nUS counterparts by 45 to 70 percent. This gap\\nexists across all sectors. When evaluating sectors\\nof similar size[14] in Western Europe and the United\\nStates (for example, advanced manufacturing,\\n\\n\\nchemicals and materials, and construction and real\\nestate), we find that those in Europe lag behind by\\n45 to 55 percent. For sectors that are significantly\\nlarger in the United States than in Western Europe\\n(for example, healthcare and pharma, high tech and\\nsoftware, and media and entertainment), the gap\\nwas even more pronounced, ranging from 50 to\\n70 percent (Exhibit 3).\\n\\nWhen looking at external spending on AI\\ninfrastructure, software, and services, Western\\nEurope lags behind the United States by an\\naverage of 61 percent for sectors of similar size\\nand 71 percent for sectors that are two or\\nmore times larger in the United States than in\\nWestern Europe.\\n\\nLooking at internal IT spend, we see that for sectors\\nof similar size, Western Europe lags behind the\\nUnited States by an average of 43 percent, and by\\n46 percent when sectors differ in size by at least\\ntwo times.\\n\\nPer the 2023 McKinsey Global Survey on the\\nstate of AI, Europe lags behind North America in\\ngen AI adoption by 30 percent, with 40 percent\\nof surveyed North American companies reporting\\nhaving adopted gen AI in at least one business\\nfunction, compared with about 30 percent for\\nsurveyed European companies.[15]\\n\\n\\n12 The online survey was in the field from April 11 to April 21, 2023, and garnered responses from 1,684 participants representing the full range\\n\\nof regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures.\\n\\n13 Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,\\n\\nand the United Kingdom.\\n\\n14 Sectors with a size ratio between Western Europe and the United States below 2:1\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n###### Western Europe lags behind the United States in AI and IT spending across sectors, with an average gap of 45–70 percent.\\n\\n\\nSpending gap between Western Europe[1]\\nand US in 2022, by sector\\n\\nSpending as share of sales in sectors of similar size,[2] %\\n\\n\\nAI external spending Western Europe US\\n\\nIT internal spending Western Europe US\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\\n\\n\\nConstruction and real estate\\n\\nChemicals and materials\\n\\nAdvanced manufacturing\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\nEnergy and utilities\\n\\nTelecommunications\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nAgriculture\\n\\nProfessional services\\n\\n\\nAI external spending _Average gap in relative value to sales_\\n\\n\\nIT internal spending\\n\\n\\n_Average gap in relative value to sales_ **55%**\\n\\n_Average gap in relative value to sales 45%_\\n\\n\\nAbsolute spending in sectors of difering size,[3] $ billion Western Europe US\\n\\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\\n\\nConsumer goods and retail\\n\\nBanking and capital markets\\n\\nHealthcare and pharma\\n\\nHigh tech and software\\n\\nMedia and entertainment\\n\\n\\nAI external spending\\n\\nIT internal spending\\n\\n\\n_Average gap in absolute value 70%_\\n\\n_Average gap in absolute value 50%_\\n\\n\\nNote: AI external spending measured as external spending on AI infrastructure, software, and services.

The chip-manufacturing and\\n\\nsemiconductor industries require more than\\n40 raw materials, 16 of which (for example,\\ngallium, magnesium, and silicon) the European\\nUnion classifies as both critical and strategic.[16]\\nAbout 5 percent of these materials are supplied\\nby European companies. As a result, the region\\nrelies heavily on imports from countries such\\nas China, which supplies about 75 percent\\nof the European Union’s needs in silicon\\nand 90 percent of its needs in gallium and\\nmagnesium.[17] The Critical Raw Materials Act\\n(CRMA) supports local production, streamlining\\npermitting processes and boosting the\\nrecycling of key materials.[18]\\n\\n— AI semiconductor equipment. The\\n\\nNetherlands–based ASML is the market\\nleader for the lithography machines required\\nto produce high-end semiconductors (up\\nto seven-nanometer logic) suitable for AI.[19]\\nEuropean companies also lead in other\\nequipment segments, such as atomic layer\\ndeposition (ASM International, also based\\nin the Netherlands, with about a 50 percent\\nmarket share) and metal–organic chemicalvapor deposition (Germany-based company\\nAIXTRON, with 70 to 80 percent market\\nshare).[20] Yet, in other key niches, like dry etchers\\nand dicing machines, European companies are\\nless present.\\n\\n— AI semiconductor design. European\\n\\ncompanies like Infineon Technologies, NXP\\nSemiconductors, and STMicroelectronics\\nplay a global role in the semiconductorintegrated-design-manufacturing space, with\\nabout 15 percent market share in 2023.[21] But\\nEurope has less of a presence in the design\\n\\n\\nof AI-suitable semiconductors, a space led\\nby Nvidia.[22] Nonetheless, some European\\nplayers are taking steps to bridge the gap.\\nBritain-based ARM has ambitions to launch AI\\nsemiconductors in 2025.[23] Europe also plays an\\nimportant, if indirect, role in AI semiconductor\\ndesign through its strong position in the design\\nand manufacturing of power semiconductors\\n(for example, through Infineon and\\nSTMicroelectronics).\\n\\n— AI semiconductor manufacturing. Europe\\n\\nproduces only about 8 percent of the world’s\\nsemiconductors and fewer than 1 percent of the\\nlogic capacity semiconductors of up to seven\\nnanometers suitable for AI.[24] Beyond that,\\nEurope has no capacity for high-bandwidth\\nmemory (HBM) and advanced packaging.\\nLooking ahead, global capacity for advanced\\nsemiconductor manufacturing is expected to\\ncontinue to be fully owned by non-European\\nplayers, such as TSMC.[25] In large part, that’s\\nbecause fab payback time in Europe is higher\\nthan that of Southeast Asia, notably due to\\nhigher labor and energy costs. In addition to\\nhigher costs, European companies also face\\ncomplex administrative processes.

Research\\n\\nfrom MGI indicates that to reap the full\\n[productivity dividends of gen AI, Europe](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/a-new-future-of-work-the-race-to-deploy-ai-and-raise-skills-in-europe-and-beyond)\\n[would need to double its current pace of job](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/a-new-future-of-work-the-race-to-deploy-ai-and-raise-skills-in-europe-and-beyond)\\n[transition—from the 0.4 percent per year seen](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/a-new-future-of-work-the-race-to-deploy-ai-and-raise-skills-in-europe-and-beyond)\\nin 2016–19, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,\\nto an unprecedented 0.8 percent by 2030.[48]\\n(The effort for the United States would be\\nlower, as transition rates have already been at\\nsuch levels.) That could require the reskilling\\nof 12 million workers, roughly 6.5 percent of\\nEurope’s current workforce. These occupational\\nshifts herald a substantial evolution in workforce\\nskills: by 2030, demand for technological skills\\nis expected to increase by 25 percent compared\\nwith 2022, while demand for basic cognitive\\nskills could decline by 14 percent. To support\\nthis change, policy makers could direct students\\n[and workers toward programs that prepare](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/netherlands-advanced-building-a-future-labor-market-that-works)\\n[them for high-demand jobs.[49] They could also](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/netherlands-advanced-building-a-future-labor-market-that-works)\\nencourage partnerships among universities and\\nbusinesses. In doing so, policy makers must\\nensure that the right trainings are developed and\\noffered for reskilling and upskilling and set up\\ndedicated mechanisms to fund the trainings.\\n\\n— Attract and retain AI talent. Europe has\\n\\nslightly more AI professionals than the\\nUnited States does (in 2023, 120,000 versus\\n112,000).[50] However, while 22 percent of\\nthe world’s leading AI researchers[51] studied\\nin Europe, only 14 percent continue to work\\nin the region.[52] Compensation disparities\\nare a significant factor: in 2023, salaries for\\nsoftware developers in the United States\\n\\n\\nwere two to four times higher than those of\\ntheir European counterparts.[53] This disparity\\nis likely attributable to the greater financial\\nresources of US companies, which benefit\\nfrom larger economies of scale and higher\\nlevels of venture capital and private equity\\nfunding. Europe also lags behind the United\\nStates in AI-related research, with only two\\nuniversities in a key ranking of top institutions\\nfor AI research in 2022, compared with 15 for\\nthe United States.[54] European workers also\\n[fall behind in gen AI awareness and use: the](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)\\nlatest McKinsey Global Survey on AI finds that\\nemployees in North America are 15 percent\\nmore likely than their European counterparts to\\nuse AI regularly.[55] To address these gaps, policy\\nmakers could implement measures to enhance\\nEurope’s attractiveness to top-tier talent (for\\nexample, premiums or tax breaks for returning\\nor incoming top talent, support for research\\ninstitutions and private labs, and public grants),\\nand business leaders could focus on upskilling\\nworkers on gen AI use. More broadly, addressing\\nthe differences in scale and resources among\\nEuropean companies—through measures such\\nas establishing a 28th tech regime,[56] simplifying\\nbusiness regulations, consolidating pension\\nfunds, and enhancing support for scale-up\\nfunding—could also be beneficial.\\n\\n— Fully embrace gen AI via end-to-end\\n\\n_transformation.

Well over 200 hundred high-rise buildings will be build in Helsinki in the 2020s.[114]\\nStatues and sculptures[edit]\\nWell-known statues and monuments strongly embedded in the cityscape of Helsinki include the Keisarinnankivi (\"Stone of the Empress\", 1835), the statue of Russian Emperor Alexander II (1894), the fountain sculpture Havis Amanda (1908), the Paavo Nurmi statue (1925), the Three Smiths Statue (1932), the Aleksis Kivi Memorial (1939), the Eino Leino Statue (1953), the Equestrian statue of Marshal Mannerheim (1960) and the Sibelius Monument (1967).[116]\\nGovernment[edit]\\n In 1640, Count Per Brahe the Younger, together with some descendants of the original settlers, moved the centre of the town to the Vironniemi peninsula by the sea, today\\'s Kruununhaka district, where the Senate Square and Helsinki Cathedral are located today.[43]\\nDuring the second half of the 17th century, Helsinki, as a wooden town, suffered from regular fires, and by the beginning of the 18th century the population had fallen below 1,700. In July 2021, the American magazine Time named Helsinki as one of the world\\'s greatest places in 2021, as a city that \"can grow into a burgeoning cultural nest in the future\" and that is already known as an environmental pioneer in the world.[18] In an international Cities of Choice survey conducted in 2021 by the Boston Consulting Group and the BCG Henderson Institute, Helsinki was ranked the third best city in the world to live in, with London and New York City coming in first and second.[19][20] Opposite the Bank of Finland building is the Renaissance Revivalish the House of the Estates (1891).[77]\\nThe only visible public buildings of the Gothic Revival architecture in Helsinki are St. John\\'s Church (1891) in Ullanlinna, which is the largest stone church in Finland, and its twin towers rise to 74 meters and have 2,600 seats.[78] Other examples of neo-Gothic include the House of Nobility in Kruununhaka and the Catholic St. Henry\\'s Cathedral.[79][80]\\n'}\n",

The plan focused on a large urban square, and the initial buildings constructed in the city included the Government Palace on the east side of the square (1822), the Helsinki Old Church (1826), the Orthodox Holy Trinity Church (1826), and Engels Teater (1827), the first theatre in the city. The signal to begin hostilities was the lighting of a red lantern in the tower of the Helsinki Workers' Hall in the Hakaniemi district of the city on 26 January 1918. While the first 90 years under Russian rule were beneficial to the development of the city and the Finnish nation, the Russification of Finland began in 1899, during the reign of Nicholas II.\\n Historical population of Helsinki[edit]\\nThe population of the city grew rapidly after the relocation of the capital there in 1812, as demonstrated by the following table.[citation needed]\\nSee also[edit]\\nReferences[edit]\\nBibliography[edit]\\nExternal links[edit]\\n\"} \n",
